# ASP.NET Core Learning Project - EmployeeManagement
## Motivation
After campus hire in 2021, I have about two months gap before I join Microsoft. As a result, I decide to do some preparation. I plan to learn the basics of C# and ASP.NET Core. So, I could read the source code in Microsoft. 

After some search, I decide to do project-based learning for ASP.NET Core and then organize the knowledge into documents and Anki cards. I found a great video series on Youtube which is called [ASP.NET core tutorial for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IgC2Q5-yDE&list=PL6n9fhu94yhVkdrusLaQsfERmL_Jh4XmU&index=1). It teach me how to build a website for employee management with a user management system by ASP.NET Core. 

## Goal
After complete the video tutorial, I should be able to 
- [X] Perform all the simple CRUD operations with ASP.NET Core. 
- [X] Organize all the concepts and operations of ASP.NET Core into a document. -> [Note](https://github.com/BeginnerRudy/C.Sharp-Based-Stuff/blob/main/ASP.NET-Core/ASP.NET-Core-Note.md)
- [X] Make the concepts and operations into Anki Cards
- [X] Build a _Guitar Learning Website_ to test your CRUD ability in ASP.NET Core. -> [Guitar-LMS](https://github.com/BeginnerRudy/ASP.NET-Core-Learning-Guitar_LMS)
- [X] Write a summary to record your current progress -> [Summary](https://github.com/BeginnerRudy/C.Sharp-Based-Stuff/blob/main/ASP.NET-Core/_ASP.Net-Core-Summary.md)

## Summary
It takes me **50 hours** to compelete the tutorials and **5 days** to orgnize the concepts and operation details. Now, I am able to perform CRUD in ASP.NET Core MVC as well as has a beginner understanding about the concepts in ASP.NET Core and how does ASP.NET Core works internally. I would do a summary for this stage to record what kind of progress I have made.
